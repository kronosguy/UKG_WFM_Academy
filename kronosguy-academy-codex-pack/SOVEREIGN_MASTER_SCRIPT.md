## I. INFRASTRUCTURE OVERHAUL
All previous 'Blue-Futuristic' assets have been purged. The platform is now a hardened, console-grade terminal.

-   **Dashboard**: [platform/index.html](../platform/index.html) -> LIME/BLACK TERMINAL
-   **Sandbox**: [platform/sandbox/simulator.css](../platform/sandbox/simulator.css) -> LIME/BLACK SHELL
-   **Manifesto**: [elite/ARCHITECT_MANIFESTO.md](../elite/ARCHITECT_MANIFESTO.md) -> TERMINAL_CODEX

## II. SANDBOX SUITE
1.  **PAY_RULES**: 1:1 Configuration Simulation
2.  **ROUNDING_RULES**: 1:1 Interval Attestation
3.  **JSON_PREVIEW**: Real-time Deterministic Feedback

## III. PRODUCTION INTEGRATION
All educational tracks are routed to `https://kronosguy.com/academy/` to ensure 100% curriculum freshness while the sandbox remains your private engineering playground.
