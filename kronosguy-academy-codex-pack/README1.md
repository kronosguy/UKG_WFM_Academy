# UKG Infrastructure Playgrounds (iximiuz-Inspired)

## The "Playground" Methodology
Safe, remote sandbox environments for experimentation. Build, break, and recover UKG configuration without affecting production.

## Active Playgrounds

### 1. The Geofence Sandbox
- **Environment:** Visual map + UKG Mobile Config interface.
- **Task:** Properly calculate a polygon geofence to avoid "drift" in high-rise buildings.
- **Validation:** Automated "virtual employee" punches to test the fence.

### 2. Pay Rule Engine Playground
- **Environment:** Logic Graph Editor.
- **Task:** Debug a pay rule that is incorrectly evaluating overtime across multiple legal entities.

### 3. API & SDK Lab
- **Environment:** VS Code (Browser-based) + UKG API Endpoint.
- **Task:** Build a custom script to automate the "Emergency Rollback" of configuration changes.
