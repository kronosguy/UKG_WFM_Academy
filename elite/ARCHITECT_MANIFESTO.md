## I. THE RETRO-ARCHITECTURE MANDATE
The architecture of UKG Pro WFM is not a static configuration; it is a deterministic engine. We do not "assign" settings; we program organizational behavior. The Renown Tier demands an operator who sees through the UI into the underlying logic.

## II. DETERMINISTIC GOVERNANCE
1.  **Immutability**: Once a Pay Rule is deployed to production, it is immutable in essence. We clone and iterate; we never "tweak" live logic without audit history.
2.  **Location Trust**: Geofencing is not a restriction; it is an attestation of physical presence.
3.  **Audit Recovery**: We do not look for who broke it; we look for why the system allowed the break.

## III. OPERATIONAL HYPER-FIDELITY
The Sovereign Sandbox is our zero-risk staging ground. If it does not compute in the simulator, it does not touch the tenant.
