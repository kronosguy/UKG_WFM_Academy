#### Scoring Breakdown

```
Assessment Scoring
├─ Quiz (10 questions x 1 point) = 10 points
│  └─ Final Score: [Points Earned] / 10
├─ Practical Tasks (5 tasks x 2 points) = 10 points
│  └─ Final Score: [Points Earned] / 10
└─ Course Grade = (All Assessment Scores) / Number of Assessments
   └─ 80%+ = Pass & Earn Certificate
   └─ 70-79% = Pass Module, Cannot Pursue Certification
   └─ <70% = Must Retake Module
```

### Retaking Assessments

#### Module Quizzes
